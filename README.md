this script is pretty straight forward.
you can enable/disable max time for the admin to put in jail in the config.lua
you can change the distance from the player distance from jail to be teleported back in the config.lua
you can change the location of the jail in the config.lua
you can change the location of the default respawn in config.lua (recommanded)
you can change the name of the command in config.lua
